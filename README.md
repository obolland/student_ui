Hello, welcome to the software engineering CBUK programming challenge!

This task involves using test-driven development to write some code of
your own.

There's no time limit for completing this task. We would expect it to
take a few hours, but we understand that everyone works at their own pace,
so there's no strict deadline. We don't want to be unreasonable and want
to be respectful of your time - so you are not expected to stay up all
night coding away! As with a real project, you may want to take breaks and
your git commits will reflect this. Don't worry, you won't be marked
down for taking breaks.

As you work on your solution, you should make commits to the repository
along the way, just as you would on a real project. This is so we can
see the progression and identify how you came to the solutions you did.

This folder already contains an empty git repository. Your submission will be assessed
independently of the covering letter / CV you have already sent.

Have fun, and feel free to ask questions if anything is unclear.

## Description ##

In the `input_mis_data.json` file is some json output from a hypothetical school 
managment information API. The scenario is that we have performed a request for
students and the data need to be manipulated in a flexible way.

Unfortunately the real mis APIs are nowhere near this simple, but this
example provides more than enough complexity for the challenge!


## Your task ##

Your task is to write a program which will parse the `input_mis_data.json` file and output
the data, modelled in the same format as `output_mis_data.json`

Once you have the output data model, we would like to see you use that data in a web application to solve the following use cases:

* As a school staff user, I need to search for a student record, so i can check their details that include contact and demographic information
* As a school staff user, I need to be able to filter students by year group, so I can perform bulk actions

As an extension that will require further work with the input data model:
* As a school staff user, I need to be able to review linked contacts for a student, so I can contact parents in an emergency
* As a school staff user, I need to be able to award "stars/points" to students with special educational needs (SEN / SEN Provisions)

Provide an interface powered by the supplied data (you may want to duplicate the record for more than one student!) that provides the UI components that facilitate the above use cases. Be creative! The key things here are displaying data from a source, filtering, accessing and expanding record detail in some way, relating data to linked records and storing data against a record



## What we're looking for ##

Below is a scoring rubric that outlines the five areas for which
you will be marked. If you run out of time that's fine, but we urge you to
concentrate your time on these areas and don't get caught up handling
edge-cases and performance optimisations.

You can assume that program will only ever need to handle the json input
provided and you don't need to implement error handling.

The formatting of the output of the program is important.

### There's no need to make it into a web app or anything - a console program with text output is fine.

However, whilst we don't expect you to implement this, you might want to
consider how open the program is to handling additional input formats and different output formats
for attributes.

You are expected to write tests to guide your development, and make
regular commits to the repository so that we can see the progression of
how it developed. We don't expect the tests to provide 100% code coverage.

You may use whichever language and tools you are comfortable with.

Here are some things to think about:

* Appropriate modelling of the domain using objects
* Separation of concerns: parsing, domain modelling and output formatting
* Avoid over-engineering
